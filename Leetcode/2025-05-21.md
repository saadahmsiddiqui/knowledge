Solving a medium problem


The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)


`PAYPALISHIRING`

P     H
A   S I
Y  I   R  
P L   I   G
A     N

P         R
A       I N
Y    H  G
P  S
A I
L

The **Using Arrays for Rows** approach is optimal for converting a string into a zigzag pattern and then reading it line by line.

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
    - If `numRows` is 1, return the original string since no zigzag pattern is needed.
2. **Initialize Rows**:
    - Create an array of strings, `rows`, with `numRows` elements, each initialized to an empty string.
3. **Simulate Zigzag Pattern**:
    - Use a `row` index to track the current row.
    - Use a `step` variable to determine the direction (down or up).
    - Iterate through each character in the input string `s`:
        - Append the character to the current row.
        - Change the direction (`step`) when reaching the top or bottom row.
4. **Concatenate Rows**:
    - Join the array of rows into a single string to form the final result.
