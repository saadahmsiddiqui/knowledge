Functional requirements
- Upload a file
- download a file
- automatically sync files across devices

Out of scope
- own blob storage

Non functional requirements
- avaiability >> consistency
	- its okay for file to reflect change a little bit later
- low latency upload and download (as low as possible)
- support large files (50gb)
- resumable uploads
- high data integrity (sync accuracy)

# Step 2
Core entities

- File
- File Metadata
- User

# Step 3
