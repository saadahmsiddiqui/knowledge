# Designing YouTube

A video sharing platform that allows users to upload, view and interact with video content.

# Steps for a System Design Interview

1. Functional Requirements
	1. Features
2. Non Functional Requirements
	1. Qualities
3. Core Entities
4. API or Interface
5. Data Flow (more relevant in Data processing)
6. High level Design (simple design, satisfy functional requirements)
7. Deep Dives (non functional requirements, scalability)

# Step 1

- Functional Requirements
	- User should be able to upload videos
	- User should be able to watch/stream videos
- Ask about scale to the interviewer if he hasn't already mentioned
	- 1 million uploads per day
	- 100 million Daily active users
	- Max Video Size 256 GB
- Non Functional Requirements
	- CAP Theorem - which should be prioritized? partition tolerance in distributed system is already a given
	- Availability >> consistency for video uploading
		- It can be viewed later by another user, no need for immediate viewing
	- Support uploading and streaming large videos 256 GB
	- Low latency streaming (<500ms) true in low bandwidth as well
	- Scalability - 100m DAU, 1m uploads daily

# Step 2

- Core Entities
	- Video
	- Video Metadata
	- User

# Step 3

API or Interface

1. /upload POST API (doesn't work for large videos)
```json
{
	video,
	videoMetadata
}
```

2. /videos/:videoId GET - Returns Video & Video Metadata

# Step 4

High level design

^ This API gateway has a limitation of 10 MB, this is not gonna support large video files

^ Directly upload to S3 or object storage in chunks, pre signed URLs from object storage allow storing in chunks, AWS sdk also has a feature to upload file in chunks, utilize notification feature from object storage to update status of upload

# Step 5

Deep dive
Goal: Satisfy non functional requirements

![[Screenshot From 2025-05-21 19-01-08.png]]
- Support streaming large videos
	- Downloading entirely from s3, doesn't cut it, client memory issue, waiting time very long
	- Stream in Chunks, store chunks in S3, update metadata, store all chunk links
	- Large chunk upload, small chunk download

- Low latency also satisfied a little bit
- Transcoding - different bitrate - lower resolution

Inspecting Video container

![[Screenshot From 2025-05-21 19-06-41 1.png]]CDN Improves bottleneck of hitting S3 directly

Streaming Protocols
1. HLS
2. DASH
